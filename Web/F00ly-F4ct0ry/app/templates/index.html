                <p><span class="bold color2">Medical Mechanica</span> is a mysterious corporation that operates in large
                    factories on various planets, the
                    factories themselves looking like giant clothing irons. Exactly who works there and who runs it are
                    a
                    mystery, as all of the factories are heavily guarded by the planet's inhabitants, exemplified by
                    mall
                    cops
                    in the case of the one in Mabase. The factories have no entrances or exits, only holes along the top
                    where
                    steam pours out at different times of the day. </p>
