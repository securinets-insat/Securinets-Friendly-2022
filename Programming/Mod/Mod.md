## Description
> Rafraf was a genius at arithmetic since he was a kid. I challenged him with a small task, I will give him a natural number *'n'*, he needs to find the rest of the division of 3 to the power of n by 105.
> As an example, for n = 2 we have (3)^2 = 9. Now, 9 mod 105 = 9.
> for n = 10121232123. what's the answer for that, help him?
>
>
> PS : Don't try to brute force the solution cuz you will miss the point of the challenge!
